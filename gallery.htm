	<p>Photos along the Stawamus Chief trail. This was a challenging hike for us with an elevation gain of 630 meters at Peak 3. 
	It took us 4 an a half hours to complete and we were dying on our way up and crying on our way down!<p>

	<p>Day 2 of our trip. First hike at Mount Seymour. Had to book a pass online due to covid restrictions. 
	This was a fun hike for amateurs like us. It was a nice hour long hike on a gloomy yet peaceful day.</p>

	<p>At Seymour Creek Golf Centre, we self taught ourselves how to swing a golf club with a YouTube video. The view was pretty neat.</p>
