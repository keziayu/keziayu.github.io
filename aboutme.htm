	<h2>A little about myself</h2>
	<p> I'm born and raised in Toronto and enjoy the outdoors. 
	Albeit I do have phobia for bugs, 
	I still enjoy being active and going on hikes. 
	I studied at the Univeristy of Toronto and Graduated with 
	a Bacholors of Arts degree in Human Geography, and a double minor 
	in Environmental Geography and Geographic Information System. I was part of the Womens Varsity Rugby team 
	for 2 years and Wing and Fullback were my positions. After graduation, I fulfilled my goal to become a flight attendant. 
	I worked at WestJet Encore for a little over a year. Covid-19 hit, and I found myself laid off. 
	The airline industry really took a hit. Thus I decided to return to school. Currently, 
	I am completing a graduate certificate of Geographic Information System, Cartographic Specialist at Fleming College.</p>
