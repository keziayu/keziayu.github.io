<h2A little about myself>
<p> I'm born and raised in Toronto and enjoy the outdoors. 
Albeit I do have phobia for bugs, 
I still enjoy being active and going on hikes. 
I studied at the Univeristy of Toronto and Graduated with 
a Bacholors of Arts degree in Human Geography, and a double minor 
in Environmental Geography and Geographic Information System. I was part of the Womens Varsity Rugby team 
for 2 years and Wing and Fullback were my positions. After graduation, I fulfilled my goal to become a flight attendant. 
I worked at WestJet Encore for a little over a year. Covid-19 hit, and I found myself laid off. 
The airline industry really took a hit. Thus I decided to return to school. Currently, 
I am completing a graduate certificate of Geographic Information System, Cartographic Specialist at Fleming College.</p>
