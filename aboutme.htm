	<h2>A little about myself</h2>
	<p> I'm born and raised in Toronto and enjoy the outdoors. 
	I love traveling, being active and going on hikes. 
	I studied at the Univeristy of Toronto and Graduated with 
	a Bacholors of Arts degree in Human Geography, and a double minor 
	in Environmental Geography and Geographic Information System. I was part of the Womens Varsity Rugby team 
	for 2 years; Wing and Fullback were my positions. After graduation, I fulfilled my goal of becoming a flight attendant. 
	I worked at WestJet Encore for a little over a year. Covid-19 and 2020 came, and I found myself laid off. 
	The airline industry really took a hit. Thus I decided to return to school. Currently, 
	I am completing a graduate certificate of Geographic Information System, Cartographic Specialist at Fleming College.
	I'm gaining skills and learning a lot as I re-enter into the world of GIS. 
	This skills include: HTML, CSS, Python, ArcGISPro, AutoCad, AdobeIllustrator/MAPublisher and Geomatica.</p>
