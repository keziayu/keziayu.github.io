				<h3>A LITTLE ABOUT ME</h3>
				<p> I'm born and raised in Toronto and enjoy the outdoors. 
				I love travelling, being active and going on hikes. 
				I studied at the Univeristy of Toronto and graduated with 
				a Bacholors of Arts degree in Human Geography, and a double minor 
				in Environmental Geography and Geographic Information System (GIS). I was part of the Womens Varsity Rugby team 
				for 2 years; Wing and Fullback were my positions.</p>
				<p>After graduation, I fulfilled my goal of becoming a flight attendant. 
		 		I worked at WestJet Encore for a little over a year but due to Covid-19 I found myself laid off. 
				The airline industry really took a hit. Thus began my journey back to GIS.</p> 
				<p>I love maps and so I decided to return to school and am currently 
			 	completing a graduate certificate of Geographic Information System, Cartographic Specialist at Fleming College.
				I'm gaining skills and learning a lot as I re-enter into the world of GIS.
				These skills include: HTML, CSS, Python, ArcGISPro, AutoCad, AdobeIllustrator, MAPublisher and Geomatica.</p>
				<p>Thank you for visiting my wesite! Happy to share about my one week visit to Vancouver.
				Feel free to connect with me to talk more about travelling orHappy to share my one week trip to Vancouver  GIS!</p>
